#This is a little work I do with my friends
## In the 24 hours, we have an idea. We have done the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Audio interaction.  And we use laser cutting  to make the model. Use arduino and electric steering engine to complete the mechanical part.
This is the link of the video to show the work
